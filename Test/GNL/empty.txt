    My preciousness.

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
          The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long
          life. For five hundred years it poisoned
          his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's
          cave...

FADE UP: Bathed in COLD MOONLIGHT, the WORLD lies DARK and
STILL...the unsettled quiet before the storm...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Darkness crept back into the forests of
          the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in the
          East...whispers of a nameless fear. And
          the Ring of Power perceived...its time
          had now come. It abandoned Gollum.

SLOW MOTION: unseen by its KEEPER..THE RING falls to the
MUDDY FLOOR of a MOUNTAIN TUNNEL...

                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But something happened then the Ring did
          not intend...

RING.

                      GALADRIEL
            It was picked up by the most unlikely
            creature imaginable...

                      BILBO
                (to himself)
            What's this?

A YOUNGISH LOOKING BILBO BAGGINS peers down at what lies in
his hand...PERPLEXED by what he has found.

                      GALADRIEL (V.O.)
            A Hobbit....Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

                      BILBO
                (surprised)
            A Ring.

SUDDENLY!   A VOICE SCREAMS...ITS ANGUISH RINGING through the

COLD, DANK TUNNELS...

                       GOLLUM (V.O.)
            Lost!   Lost! My Precious is lost!!

Frightened Bilbo quickly POCKETS the ONE RING and hurries on.

CONTINUED:

White flowers are scattered among the Well seeded grasses.
An idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer... the
figure is reading a book. ON THE SOUNDTRACK: In the distance,
growing louder..over the Gentle clip clop of an approaching
cart and horse can be heard the HUMMING OF A DEEP VOICE to
the tune of "The Road Goes Ever On and On..."

SUDDENLY! The figure in the grass sits up...looking straight
at camera is a handsome young HOBBIT, with dark curly hair
and deep blue eyes. This is FRODO BAGGINS...his EYES alight
with EXCITEMENT! Tossing away the long stem of grass in his
mouth, Frodo runs off.

EXT. SHIRE LANE -- DAY

The cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped
figure in Grey.

INTERCUT WITH; SHOTS OF FRODO RUNNING... CAREERING DOWN A

HILL. . .JUMPING OVER LOGS... DODGING TREE BRANCHES.

The shambling OLD PONY snorts and rears as... SUDDENLY FRODO
appears on a bank above the cart.

                    FRODO
          You're late.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF glowers at the young Hobbit...

                    GANDALF
          A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins,
          nor is he early. He arrives precisely
          when he means to.

They look at each other a moment..then both start laughing as
FRODO'S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front
seat of the cart.

                    FRODO
          It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

Next to Gandalf, we see how small Hobbits are...Frodo is 3
foot 6 inches tall.

                    GANDALF
          You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle
          Bilbo's birthday?

EXT. HOBBITON FIELDS -- DAY

Wide on: The cart rattles past a FIELD LUPIN being tended by

HOBBITS.

                     FRODO
           What news of the outside world? Tell me
           everything!

                                                       ANGLE ON:

Gandalf looks down at Frodo, a twinkle in his eye.

                     GANDALF
           What, everything? Far too eager and
           curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural...

Wide on: The cart rattles over a Stone bridge towards a Busy
Hobbit Marketplace.

                      GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Well, what can I tell you? Life in the
           wide world goes on much as if it has past
           age. Full of its own comings and goings,
           scarcely even aware of the existence of
           Hobbits...

Close on: Gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before
him.

                     GANDALF (CONT'D)
           ...for which I am very thankful.

                                                       ANGLE ON:

Hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the
cart bearing Gandalf and Frodo rolls past the Green Dragon
Inn...towards... Wide on: The party field. Where scOrcs of
Hobbits are busy preparing for the big night.

                     GANDALF (CONT'D)
           Ah, the long expected party. So, how is
           the old rascal? I hear it's going to be
           a Party of Special Magnificence.

                     FRODO
           You know Bilbo...he's got he whole place
           in an uproar.

                     GANDALF
           Oh, well...that should please him.

          Half the Shire's been invited...

                    GANDALF
          Good gracious, me.

                    FRODO
          He's up to something.

                    GANDALF
          Oh, really?

Frodo shoots a knowing look, as Gandalf averts his eyes.

                    FRODO
          Alright then..keep your secrets. Before
          you came along we Bagginses were very
          well thought of.

                       GANDALF
          Indeed?

                    FRODO
          Never had any adventures or did anything
          unexpected.

                    GANDALF
          If you're referring to the incident with
          the Dragon...I was barely involved...all
          I did was give your Uncle a little nudge
          out the door.

                    FRODO
          Whatever you did...you've been officially
          labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.

                    GANDALF
          Oh, really?

                                                       ANGLE ON:

ODO PROUDFOOT looks up as the Cart passes by, deeply
suspicious.

As the cart rattles into the small village of Hobbiton...a
quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills
and large trees.

CONTINUED:

The Hobbits live in Hobbit Holes: neat burrows dug into the
grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens.

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Excited children, chasing after the cart.

                                                     CLOSE ON:

Gandalf ignOrcs the children's cries. The children stand
deflated, watching Gandalf disappear up the lane. At that
moment: spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of
the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children.

                                                     ANGLE ON:

Gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke. ODO
PROUDFOOT is unable to suppress a chuckle. Frodo stands up in
the cart as Gandalf reigns in the horse.

                    FRODO
          Gandalf... I'm glad you're back. Frodo
          leaps expertly from the cart. Gandalf
          smiles.

          So am I, dear boy...so am I

EXT. BAG END -- DAY

Wide on: GANDALF'S CART pulls up outside the gate to BAG
END...a particularly fine example of a Hobbit hole, with a
large round front door set into a grassy hillside. There is
a sign on the gate which reads: "NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON
PARTY BUSINESS." Gandalf strides up to the garden path of Bag
End. He raises his staff and raps on the front door...a
voice calls out:

                     BILBO (O.S.)
          No, thank you! We don't want any more
          visitors, well wishers, or distant
          relations.

                    GANDALF
          And what about very old friends?

Suddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him.
He is a HOBBIT OF INDERTIMINATE AGE, with a mischievous
Twinkle in his eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he
looks every inch the eccentric gentleman.

                    BILBO
          My dear Gandalf!

Gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.

                    GANDALF
          It's good to see you. One hundred and
          eleven years old, who would believe it!

Gandalf looks at him more keenly.

                    GANDALF (CONT'D)
          You haven't aged a day! Gandalf and Bilbo
          laugh together and enter Bag End.

          Come on, come in!   Welcome, welcome!!

INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Bilbo leads Gandalf into Bag End...cozy and cluttered with
souvenirs of Bilbo's travels. Gandalf has to stoop to avoid
hitting his head on the low ceiling. Bilbo hangs up Gandalf's
hat on a peg and trots off down the hall.

                    BILBO
              (Calling)
          Tea? Or maybe something stronger... I've
          a few bottles of the Old Winyard left,
          1296...a very good year, almost as old as
          I am. It was laid down by my father. What
          say we open one, eh?

Bilbo disappears into the kitchen as Gandalf looks
around..enjoying the familiarity of Bag End...he turns,
knocking his head on the light and then walking into the
wooden beam. He groans.

                    BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I was expecting you some time last week.
          Not that it matters, you come and go as
          you please, always have done, always
          will.

          You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm
          afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit
          of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no,
          that might be a little risky...

Gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one
corner...it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf
smiles to himself.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple
          tart...got some custard somewhere. Not
          much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh
          no...we're alright...I've just found some
          sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope
          it's enough.
              (comes into view)
          I could do you some eggs if you like?

Bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf
mysteriously appears behind him.

                    GANDALF
          Just tea, thank you.

                       BILBO
          Oh..right.     You don't mind if...?

                    GANDALF
          No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud
          knock on the front door.

MRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS (O.S.)

Bilbo Baggins, you open this door..I know you're in there.

                    BILBO
          I'm not home.

Gandalf watches, amused as Bilbo tries to hide.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I've got to get away from these
          confounded relatives, hanging on the bell
          all day, never giving me a moment's
          peace. I want to see mountains
          again...mountains, Gandalf... and then
          find somewhere quiet where I can finish
          my book...Oh, Tea!

                    GANDALF
          So, you mean to go through with your
          plan, then?

          arrangements are made.

                    GANDALF
          Frodo suspects something.

                    BILBO
          'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not

          Yes, yes.

                    GANDALF
          He's very fond of you.

                    BILBO
          I know. He'd probably come with me if I
          asked him. I think, in his heart,
          Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the
          woods and the fields... little rivers.
          Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen
          window.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)

          I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning
          to feel it in my heart.

Bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket...gripping
a small, unseen object.

                    BILBO (CONT'D)
          I feel thin...sort of stretched, like
          butter scraped over too much bread. I
          need a holiday...a very long holiday and
          I don't expect I shall return...in fact,
          I mean not to.

INT. BAG END -- EVENING

Gandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch. Below
them, final preparations are being made on the Party field.
Bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe.

          Old Toby, the finest weed in
          Southfarthing!

Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the
air. A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through
the Center of Bilbo's smoke ring.

branches. TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down
from the branches...evaporating just above the up turned
faces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and
drinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the
tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories.
Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark
that dances magically from his staff... Bilbo is greeting
visitors. Frodo and SAM sit at a table drinking ale...Frodo
notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit,
Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away.

                    FRODO
          Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.

                     SAM
               (horrified)
          I think I'll just have myself another
          ale.

                    FRODO
          Oh, no you don't. Go on.

Sam goes to drain his glass... suddenly it is snatched out of
his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing
throng of dancers.

                                                            15.



ANGLE ON: SAM'S HORRIFIED FACE

as he is Swept away.   Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer.

                                                      ANGLE ON:

Gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework
that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests.

Close on: Bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a
group of young hobbit children.

                    BILBO
              (melodramatic)
          So, there I was...at the mercy of three
          monstrous trolls...Have you ever heard of
          a troll? Do you know what a Troll is?
          Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly
          things..and they're arguing...arguing
          about how they were going to cook us!

ANGLE ON: A LITTLE HOBBIT GIRL'S
